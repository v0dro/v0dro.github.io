Searching for decent jam rooms and studios is quite task if you don't know the right people. In this post I will list out the jam rooms and studios that I've been to in Pune and also write a short review about each of them so you can choose wisely. Mind you this list is kind of small since I've not been to too many yet :P

# Jam Rooms

### Jam Works by Divine Music (Camp)

### Just Jam (near MIT, Kothrud)
