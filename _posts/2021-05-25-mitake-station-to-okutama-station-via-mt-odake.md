# Introduction

A long hike starting from Mitake station and ending at Okutama
station can be done by using the trail that goes over Mt. Mitake,
Mt. Odake and Mt. Nokogiri, among others. The hike takes a full
6 hours to finish from the bottom of the Mitake ropeway until
Okutama station, although the evevation is gradual and terrain
easy to hike. This is same hike as described in this
[blog](https://ridgelineimages.com/hiking/mt-odake/).

# Access

1. Take the Chuo Line until Mitake station.
2. From Mitake station take the bus to Tanigata station, which
  is the start of the cablecar train up Mt. Mitake.
3. Make your way to Okutama station along the trail noted above.
4. Back to Tokyo from Okutama station over the Chuo Line.

# Details of the hike

The bus from Mitake station until the ropeway was unusually
crowded given the COVID-19 emergency situation, so we decided
to walk all the way from Mitake station to the base of the
ropeway, which took about an hour.

The trail proper starts from here and it takes about an hour
more to reach the upper station of the cable car on foot. The
tar road to the upper station is well maintained and full usable
in any weather.

From here keep walking straight for about 30 min until the
Mitake Rock Garden, which also affords views of the Mitake
shrine along the way. The Rock Garden is roughly where the
tar road ends and you can finally find yourself walking on
some earth. From here you can take two trails that lead to
Mt. Odake - a less steep but longer trail of about 3.6 KM
and a shorter but more challenging trail of about 2.5 KM. We
took the latter and had a great time.

The first summit you reach along this trail is Mt. at about 1066m.
From here, the summit of Mt. Odake takes about 1.5 hours.
