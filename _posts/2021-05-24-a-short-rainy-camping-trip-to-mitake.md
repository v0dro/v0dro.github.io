title: A short rainy camping trip to Mitake

 I had an evening and morning free over the weekend, so to my mind
 off work I decided to head for a short impromptu camping trip to
 one of the many camping places around Tokyo. Unfortunately all
 of the ones I called turned out to be fully booked, and therefore
 I decided to do my first ever solo camping trip in the wild,
 which was only made somewhat more interesting and challenging
 by rain throughout the evening.


 Since this was to be my first wild camping trip, I decided to choose
 a safe spot not too far from the nearest human habitat, but sufficiently
 close to nature so as to enhance my solo camping experience. I decided
 to head to [Mitake station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitake_Station_(Tokyo))
 and then walk down the Tama river in order to find a suitable spot to
 find a place to camp the night. Having been to the riverbank for bouldering
 in the past, I was aware that there are some good flat spots along the river
 to pitch a tent.

 After reaching the valley, I zeroed on a spot a few minutes downstream from
 Mitake station to pitch a tent. The boulder provided some shelter from the
 wind, and the sand made it easy to hammer the pegs in.

 Pitching a tent alone in the rain was a lesson in itself, having done
 this sort of thing with a friend all the time in the past. The key is
 to first place the ground sheet and the bottom part of the tent on the
 ground and hammer the four ends of the tent and sheet into the ground
 using pegs. Once this stays fastend you can easily setup the frame on
 the tent and set it upright. Putting the tarp is then a straightforward
 procedure. Take care to not let the tarp touch the inner part of the
 tent since this can lead to condensation reaching the insides (and
 dripping on you).

 Once inside the tent, I settled down with hot coffee and cup
 ramen, and watched the river and rain as the sun set. Although it was
 raining throughout the night, the next morning was luckily clear
 and sunny. There is a hydro electric power plant upstream from Mitake
 and they sometimes release water if it rains too much. I must I was
 a little paranoid about rising water levels (and woke up a couple of
 times to check the water level) through the night but luckily no such
 thing happened.

 I took a swim in the river in the morning and enjoyed a cup of coffee
 and more cup ramen sitting by the river. Then I wound up my tent
 and made my way back to Tokyo from Mitake Station.

 Access:
 1. Reach Mitake station on the Chuo Line.
 2. Walk straight over the bridge directly facing the station.
 3. On the right side immediately after the bridge, take the trail
    leading to the river bank.
 4. Get off the trail on the left side, and walk a little along the
    rocky riverbank until you see a sandy clearing with a large boulder.

Below are some of the videos and images I took on this excursion.
