I submitted a talk proposal to Ruby Kaigi this year, which was selected. It's one of the largest Ruby conferences in the world and I feel it's a great honour to be talking there. In this blog post I have put my experience as a first time visitor of Japan and as a speaker at Ruby Kaigi. I spent a total of 10 days in Japan (5th September to 15th September).

My journey starts on the 4th of September. I took an ANA flight from Mumbai airport to Tokyo (via Delhi).
